# BHTO19_GradientsVariability

***Brainhack Global Toronto 2019 Project - Inter-subject variability in Marguliesian Gradientage***

This repo is the organizing space for our 2019 BrainHack Global Toronto Project on inter-subject variability in fMRI 'gradients'.

We will be working on this project during the 3-day hack in November, plus a little prep beforehand and as yet undetermined amount of time afterwards. 

This is a more-or-less fully 'de novo' project, in that it is not a direct continuation and extension of existing tools or projects. It's a new idea that we were interested in exploring. 

See below for the scientific and technical rationale. 

Importantly: planning, reporting, management, and discussion of project activities is being done through the **Github Issues List** (see tab at top of the page). 

***If you are interested in joining the project***, simply go to the issues page and add a new issue/post introducing yourself. We can then add you as a collaborator on the repo and grant write access.
